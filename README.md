# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built using React.js. It showcases your personal information, skills, experiences, hobbies, and languages. The website is designed as a single-page application with a non-scrollable layout. It utilizes React hooks for managing state and component lifecycle.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Create React App: A tool for creating React applications with a predefined project structure and build configurations.
- React Hooks: Used to manage state and lifecycle within functional components.
- HTML and CSS: Used for structuring and styling the website layout.
- JavaScript: Used for interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## Project Structure

The project follows the basic structure provided by Create React App:

- `public/`: Contains the public assets and the HTML template file.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React application.
  - `components/`: Contains individual components used in the website.
  - `App.js`: The main component that serves as the entry point of the application.
  - `index.js`: The file responsible for rendering the React application into the HTML template.
- `App.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the application.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd portfolio-fe-test`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Customization

Feel free to customize the content and styling of the portfolio website according to your needs:

- Update the information in each component by modifying the relevant JSX code in the corresponding component file.
- Customize the CSS styles in the `App.css` file to change the overall appearance of the website.

## Deployment

To deploy the portfolio website to a hosting platform, you can follow these steps:

1. Build the production-ready files: `npm run build`
2. The build process will generate an optimized version of the website in the `build/` directory.
3. Upload the contents of the `build/` directory to your hosting provider.

Make sure to check the hosting provider's documentation for specific instructions on how to deploy a React application.
